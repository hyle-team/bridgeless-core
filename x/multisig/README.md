# `x/multisig`

## Abstract

The main goal of this module is to provide implementation which allows the creation and management of on-chain
multi-signature accounts and enables message execution based on the multi-signed message.
As an example of implementation ```x/group``` module from Cosmos SDK will be taken.

----

## Concepts

The main differences between implementations:

- Decision policy will be stored in the group entity.
- There will be only one decision policy – threshold decision policy.
- No group member entity - the base account will be used instead.
- No group administrator – the group will be managed by itself. The group member has to send a multi-signed message to
  remove or add a new member. The same flow works for other operations unrelated to the group management.
- The group member can’t leave the group at will.
- If the message is valid – it will be executed automatically by the module, instead of manually execution.

The multi-signature feature works in the following way:

- Every group has its own subaccount that holds the tokens.
- Any of group members creates the proposal to execute some messages.
- Group members votes for the proposal
- After voting period module calculates the results.
- If 'YES' votes count reaches the threshold module executes the messages.
  By executing messages in module we can skip the signature check that default transaction do automatically.
  So the module 'replaces' the default tx signature check with its own rules.

## State

### Params

Definition:

```protobuf
message Params {
  option (gogoproto.goproto_stringer) = false;
  uint64 groupSequence = 1;
  uint64 proposalSequence = 2;
  uint64 prunePeriod = 3;
  uint64 votingPeriod = 4;
}
```

Example:

```json
{
  "groupSequence": 0,
  "proposalSequence": 0,
  "prunePeriod": 240,
  "votingPeriod": 120
}
```

### Group

**Group** - stores the aggregation of group member account addresses. It is a module’s sub-account and has a balance.
The group’s account address is derived from the module account address and group ID.
The module uses the group sequence parameter to generate a group ID for producing the group account address.
The group sequence is an integer stored in the module's parameters and increments during new group creation.

Definition:

```protobuf
message Group {
  string account = 1;
  repeated string members = 2;
  uint64 threshold = 3;
}
```

Example:

```json
{
  "account": "rarimo....",
  "members": [
    "rarimo...",
    "rarimo..."
  ],
  "threshold": 1
}
```

### Proposal

**Proposal** - proposal to execute some operation that should be signed by group.

Definition:

```protobuf
enum VoteOption {
  YES = 0;
  NO = 1;
}

// ProposalStatus defines proposal statuses.
enum ProposalStatus {
  // Initial status of a proposal when submitted.
  SUBMITTED = 0;
  // Status of a proposal when it passes the group's decision policy.
  ACCEPTED = 1;
  // Status of a proposal when it is rejected by the group's decision policy.
  REJECTED = 2;
  // Status of a proposal when it is successfully executed by the module.
  EXECUTED = 3;
  // Status of a proposal when execution is failed.
  FAILED = 4;
}

// Proposal defines a group proposal. Any member of a group can submit a proposal
// for a module to decide upon.
// A proposal consists of a set of `sdk.Msg`s that will be executed if the proposal
// passes as well.
message Proposal {
  // Account address of the proposer.
  string proposer = 1;
  // Unique id of the proposal.
  uint64 id = 2;
  // Account address of the group.
  string group = 3;
  // Block height when the proposal was submitted.
  uint64 submitBlock = 5;
  // Status represents the high level position in the life cycle of the proposal. Initial value is Submitted.
  ProposalStatus status = 8;
  // Contains the sums of all votes for this proposal for each vote option.
  // It is empty at submission, and only populated after tallying, at voting end block.
  TallyResult finalTallyResult = 9;
  // Block height before which voting must be done.
  uint64 votingEndBlock = 10;
  // List of `sdk.Msg`s that will be executed if the proposal passes.
  repeated google.protobuf.Any messages = 12;
}

// TallyResult represents the sum of votes for each vote option.
message TallyResult {
  // Sum of yes votes.
  uint64 yesCount = 1;
  // Sum of no votes.
  uint64 noCount = 3;
}

// Vote represents a vote for a proposal.
message Vote {
  // Unique ID of the proposal.
  uint64 proposalId = 1;
  // Voter is the account address of the voter.
  string voter = 2;
  // Option is the voter's choice on the proposal.
  VoteOption option = 3;
  // Block height when the vote was submitted.
  uint64 submitBlock = 5;
}
```

## Transactions

## RPC

### SubmitProposal

**SubmitProposal** - creates proposal to execute some set of messages signed by group account.

```protobuf
message MsgSubmitProposal {
  string creator = 1;
  string group = 2;
  repeated google.protobuf.Any messages = 3;
}
```

### Vote

**Vote** - vote for proposal.

```protobuf
message MsgVote {
  string creator = 1;
  uint64 proposalId = 2;
  VoteOption option = 3;
}
```

### CreateGroup

**CreateGroup** - creating of the new group.

```protobuf
message MsgCreateGroup {
  string creator = 1;
  repeated string members = 2;
  uint64 threshold = 3;
}
```

### ChangeGroup

**ChangeGroup** - changing group parameters or set of participants.
The signer of that message should be a group account, so that message can be executed only from that module using
multisig flow.

```protobuf
message MsgChangeGroup {
  string creator = 1;
  string group = 2;
  repeated string members = 3;
  uint64 threshold = 4;
}
```
